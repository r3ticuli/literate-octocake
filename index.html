      <br>"Hey. You got it?"<br>
      <br>"Yeah. Yeah, I think I do."<br>
      <br>"Well don't fucking sit around you fuck, the Penitents are you coming. Fast, remember?"<br>
      <br>"Yeah, I guess."<br>
      <br>"Hurry kid, just fucking slide it in."<br>
      <br>"Yeah, yeah, I know."<br>
      <br>"^^4000 has been credited into your account. Don't spend it all in one place, you stupid fuck."<br>

      <br>Nayl grunted. "Another stupid fucking kid that can't even use a p-reader right." He doused the clove cigarette and sniffed the air. You could already smell the incense; the Penitents really were coming.<br>
      <br>"Well fuck, I better get on the hypertram."<br>

      <br>Nayl quickly ducked into the nearest hypertram station. It doesn't take long to find one, but the scent of incense was growing stronger. Out here in the subleves, there weren't a lot of cops around, so Nayl ducked through the forced field, accepting the sharp twang of pain as a necessary evi for riding on free.<br>

    <p>Its resonating with me. Its touching a part of me I haven’t felt in ages. When I was a kid and would build these fake cities out of milk crates and would roleplay random peoples lives—playing God.</p>
