	  The exceptional balancing act of the tantric geometries has been studied thoroughly in the past, especially in tilled fields, oxen, horses, chickens. However, the particular anglogugular pneumatics have yet to be uncovered. Aufzen and Martinelli's investigations often discuss such eccentricities such as the laForgean phenomena of agglutination, wherein the silt, geothermal and amorphous minerals as well as the alum oxides have been plowed. And much has been made of the domestication of the animal and its role in such blasé conditions. In fact, it is a fantastic rupture from the past and the French Revolution that epitomized the epistolary letters, Liberté, égalité, fraternité, of course, being the socioeconomic conditions that fostered trade conditions was a common staying pattern for the time being, the secularity and the militarily, the profound and the ideological, the sovereignty and psychosexual all coalesced into an exception brew of class warfare. It was smoother than Vueve Clicquot. As the selected works of Echonachal show, the concept of modernity was aggregated from ideas of the pastoral landscape. Before the agricultural revolution, man lived in a state of des déchets. In a similarly compelling diaspora, men of blood type B have developed a cultural system of shame and penance. As with the levée en masse, Napoleon's pioneered a unique technique of attack. The greater mobility of the troops and the exalted blood curlding spear throwing axe wielding fusillade firing mortar shelling front assaults absolutely paralyzed the command and control structures of the enemy's entrenched defenses. Like a great dam breaking or the straw on the camel's back, countless mercenary forces overwhelmed the spindle-like minarets and moats. A brutality of modernity. The desultory sanatorium brains foretold of this absolute collapse, a reckoning bottled up and long coming, cracking at the seams.</p>

    <br>“How the fuck are you gonna pretend you know where the tram goes?"<br>
<br>"Fuck man, I told you; I thought this was it." The entire surrounding urban scape was triple-gentrified, three-and-a-halfer bullshit. Last regime bullshit. Dated bullshit. These people were comfy, safe, had enough money to 3D-print their groceries and ass plugs and nothing else. Where the fuck was someone going to find a p-reader out here?<br>

<br>Nayl grunted. He always was fucking grunting. He knew it. She told him. "Stop fucking grunting." So he kept grunting. He grunted as he bumped shoulders with the nice man in the sweater as he got off the tram. People don't bump shoulders here. They're all prim and proper. The tram station was pastel yellow. Everything was in pastels. Nayl felt the itch. Nayl knew the contact was halfway across Neo-Chicago busting his fucking chips to the boss. A grunt as he knew what the boss was gonna say. Thus wasn't even his fault. This kid wanted to come along. What was the point in saying no? So Nayl followed him half-asleep to the other fucking side of the city.<br>

    <p>
      <br>"Hey. You got it?"<br>
      <br>"Yeah. Yeah, I think I do."<br>
      <br>"Well don't fucking sit around you fuck, the Penitents are you coming. Fast, remember?"<br>
      <br>"Yeah, I guess."<br>
      <br>"Hurry kid, just fucking slide it in."<br>
      <br>"Yeah, yeah, I know."<br>
      <br>"^^4000 has been credited into your account. Don't spend it all in one place, you stupid fuck."<br>

      <br>Nayl grunted. "Another stupid fucking kid that can't even use a p-reader right." He doused the clove cigarette and sniffed the air. You could already smell the incense; the Penitents really were coming.<br>
      <br>"Well fuck, I better get on the hypertram."<br>

      <br>Nayl quickly ducked into the nearest hypertram station. It doesn't take long to find one, but the scent of incense was growing stronger. Out here in the subleves, there weren't a lot of cops around, so Nayl ducked through the forced field, accepting the sharp twang of pain as a necessary evi for riding on free.<br>

    <p>Its resonating with me. Its touching a part of me I haven’t felt in ages. When I was a kid and would build these fake cities out of milk crates and would roleplay random peoples lives—playing God.</p>
  
	  <h4>the BIG grunt</h4>
	  <p>Nayl grunted, yet again. A thrust in an out. Business for businesses sake. 

Sweat glistened off of his bicep. The reader was exhausted. "What's the matter kid, cat got your tounge?" "Fuck you Mang this is just my job." 

Nayl was getting used to it. He grunted. He's always grunting. She wont shut the fuck up  about it whenever nayl gets home.

The hypertram was empty. Boss knows going on. They all know what's going on. Nayl is losing his edge. His thrusts are getting weaker. The gold contacts just aren't connecting quite as forcefully as they used to connect. He grunted. The hypertram was empty today. And he even paid the fare. The six last nitrobux he had to hisname, leaving him an empty fridge. She'd be pissed. He grunted. This payment wasn't coming in until the next business day.
