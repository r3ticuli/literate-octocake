      “Hey. You got it?"
“Yeah. Yeah, I think I do.”
“Well don't fucking sit around you fuck, the Penitents are you coming. Fast, remember?"
“Yeah, I guess.”
“Hurry kid, just fucking slide it in.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know.”
"^^4000 has been credited into your account. Don't spend it all in one place you stupid fuck.“

Nayl grunted. “Another stupid fucking kid that can't even use a p-reader right." He doused the clove cigarette and sniffed the air. You could already smell the incense; the Penitents really were coming.
“Well fuck, I better get on the hypertram."

Nayl quickly ducked into the nearest hypertram station. It doesn't take long to find one, but the scent of incense was growing stronger. Out here in the subleves, there weren't a lot of cops around, so Nayl ducked through the forced field, accepting the sharp twang of pain as a necessary evi for riding on free.
      It's resonating with me. It's touching a part of me I haven’t felt in ages. When I was a kid and would build these fake cities out of milk crates and would roleplay random peoples lives—playing God.</p>
