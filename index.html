    <br>“How the fuck are you gonna pretend you know where the tram goes?"<br>
<br>“Fuck man, I told you; I thought this was it." The entire surrounding urban scape was triple-gentrified, three-and-a-halfer bullshit. Last regime bullshit. Dated bullshit. These people were comfy, safe, had enough money to 3D-print their groceries and ass plugs and nothing else. Where the fuck was someone going to find a p-reader out here?<br>

<br>Nayl grunted. He always was fucking grunting. He knew it. She told him. "Stop fucking grunting." So he kept grunting. He grunted as he bumped shoulders with the nice man in the sweater as he got off the tram. People don't bump shoulders here. They're all prim and proper. The tram station was pastel yellow. Everything was in pastels. Nayl felt the itch. Nayl knew the contact was halfway across Neo-Chicago busting his fucking chips to the boss. A grunt as he knew what the boss was gonna say. Thus wasn't even his fault. This kid wanted to come along. What was the point in saying no? So Nayl followed him half-asleep to the other fucking side of the city.<br>

      <br>"Hey. You got it?"<br>
      <br>"Yeah. Yeah, I think I do."<br>
      <br>"Well don't fucking sit around you fuck, the Penitents are you coming. Fast, remember?"<br>
      <br>"Yeah, I guess."<br>
      <br>"Hurry kid, just fucking slide it in."<br>
      <br>"Yeah, yeah, I know."<br>
      <br>"^^4000 has been credited into your account. Don't spend it all in one place, you stupid fuck."<br>

      <br>Nayl grunted. "Another stupid fucking kid that can't even use a p-reader right." He doused the clove cigarette and sniffed the air. You could already smell the incense; the Penitents really were coming.<br>
      <br>"Well fuck, I better get on the hypertram."<br>

      <br>Nayl quickly ducked into the nearest hypertram station. It doesn't take long to find one, but the scent of incense was growing stronger. Out here in the subleves, there weren't a lot of cops around, so Nayl ducked through the forced field, accepting the sharp twang of pain as a necessary evi for riding on free.<br>

    <p>Its resonating with me. Its touching a part of me I haven’t felt in ages. When I was a kid and would build these fake cities out of milk crates and would roleplay random peoples lives—playing God.</p>
