there was a mansion with a large hall. this is where you were once living probably. there are a lot of opulent curtains and there are a lot of layers in the home, because you have lived in a lot of different place. the curtains are very red like the ones you might see in a movie theather in the olden days where they would drop the red curtain when the movie is finished. it reminds you of a rich persons home where you always wanted to live. there are many staircases because that is what rich people like - they like to have multiple staircases in their home. there are little raised passageways on the sides of the great hall so that you can look down into the big hall while walking between rooms. the upper levels have a lot of dark rooms and sometimes you think that there are secret passageways. like when you wake up from bed once you see theres a door that you open and then you go inside, but its just your basement. there were many more levels in the basement than you believed, and there are a lot of staircases. the further down you go the darker it gets, and there are a lot of curves. the ground is kind of squishy like a dark soil or mold, and thats strange. 

you think these places you might have been to before because after all they are all based on the places you have been to before. 

theres another building that you go to a lot and its very tall. i mean everything here is in this big city, and it has a lot of dark alleyways. the dark alleyways always have these sort of shops where there are hawkers and they try to sell you food but you dont really want that sort of food. there are a lot of layers like a farmers market or an onion or the layers of a jawbreaker or a collapsed and pancaked building. the city is very gloomy

some other cities are a lot brighter and are kind of near the forest. there might be a path or a road where you once might not have thought of to that park in the south. i never thought there would be a path there but i guess there is a path there. the hillside is very hilly and its the fall so there are many leaves on the ground. the smell is very damp and musty and the leaves dont crunch because they are wet and rotting, and its very cold so that sometimes the ice freezes the leaves in to ice cubes. like trapping them when they are rotting. and the trees are bare so that you can see through the forest except there are too many branches and trunks to actually see through the forest. actually this park is a very dangerous place, kind of like the blair witch project but without the witch. you could walk around for days and then get lost there. its probably like when you took that trip to the state capital and then there was a path through the woods in the abraham lincoln memorial, except that wasnt as cold.

but this mansion, it was strange because coming out of it you can see these weird cow holograms, the holograms which show that the cows are tipped over, but not like cow tipping but instead they are dead and maybe disembowelled. that is unsettling because maybe theres some sort of wild animal or even paranormal activity disembowelling the cows, and why are they holograms anyways? the holograms are assembled in a row in the field outside of this mansion and its very neat. you get aboard the bus with the other students but its very disqueting to have seen this cow in the field. 

the one guy in the bus, he was the one responsible. we always thought he was the one, and the one about the zombies. and so we restrained him but not before he took out an axe and nicked one girl in the head so that she started to bleed a little. but we were able to restrain him i guess. inside the mansion it was worse. the professor who lived next door popped through the door and there was a lot of blood because of the zombies that had attacked before. and i had to clean that up because it was disgusting, but at least the zombies were gone. 

there was fear in the neighborhood especially on the northern end near the lake. i remember when i had to go on this tram to go over the lake because i wanted to see what the end of the tram station looked like. anyways, when i was walking back i was in this neighborhood and it seemed fine but it was really empty. it was kind of like the ideal neighborhood of middle america or something. so i was walking back but it kind of felt unsafe and then i realized that i had to run away so that i jumped some hedges
