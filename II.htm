color:#333333'>Here two issues are addressed: first of all, newness as a real
aesthetic value, and secondly the question of how digital poetry and tradition
are related. In the past few years very few terms have celebrated their
comeback with such a vengeance as newness. The new media make this possible.
Within the catchment area of digital aesthetics, there is even an avant-garde
consciousness once more. An avant-garde consciousness which often as not
reminds us in style and gesture, as well as in substance, of historic communist
manifestos. It is questionable that with the focus on new media technologies,
the most aggressive modern concept of time has been revived, i.e. progress.
Thus media art - and digital poetry as its part - is subjected to the
&quot;logic of economic exchange&quot; (Boris Groys). With the 'new' we
paradoxically catch the oldest or most traditional idea developed by Modernity
and Modernism. It is my opinion, however, that art or literature does not
progress. Rather, it extends steadily, and the concern with digital media has
supplied some impulses here. A different question is the relation to tradition.
Avant-garde consciousness comprises to make a clear break with tradition. How,
however, is this tradition portrayed? Hasn't it often enough been portrayed so
coarsely, that tradition reminds one somewhat of windmill sails: books, print
literature, the Gutenberg galaxy, and connected to these: linear narrative
techniques, one-dimensionality, depth of sense, finalism etc.. At the latest,
Romanticism had cleared up with all this to a large extent, and since Mallarmé,
Chlebnikov or Ball it is acknowledged that books and printing are, poetically
speaking, leading lights no longer. Thus the question of tradition must be
asked more positively. And this makes the next thesis necessary:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:#EEEEEE'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>There is
a common theory which states that with the computer, modern age or post-modern
literature has come into its own. That it has found an adequate or - compared
to printing - an improved medium. Hypertext Pope Jay David Bolter speaks of the
&quot;redefinition&quot; of Modernism. And Philippe Castellin sets a large
equation in the editorial of &quot;Alire 10&quot;, a French journal for digital
poetry: on one side of the equation there is a long list: poetry,
individuality, inter-media, collage, Cadavres exquis, permutation, Poésie
totale, synaesthesia, multi-sensor technology, Queneau, Schwitters, Pound,
Joyce, Petronio, Hausmann, Zaum etc.. On the other side there stands only one
French word: &quot; L'ordinateur&quot;: computers seem to have completely
bagged Modernism! I consider this to be technologically narrow-minded, and
arrogant with regard to the achievements of the last century. Modernist ways of
writing cannot be translated medially. If this is tried, then the results are
disappointing, flat and trivial. At best they are didactic. Concepts may,
however, be taken up and run through changed medial conditions. Then things can
start to get interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal;background:#EEEEEE'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;color:#333333'>Poetic
programs consist of certain concepts, principles, values, work attitudes,
questions, and aims, which orient and control individual artistic events according
to poetics. The program of literary experiment accommodates my first thesis:
experimental literature has always been about language or the signs themselves,
their technical, material, semantic and pragmatic possibilities. It has been
about breaking bounds in the direction of fine arts and music, and also towards
science. It has also been about observing the formulation and understanding
process of producers and recipients. Therefore, experimental poetry has always
been media poetry. There is simply no other literary terrain, where
technological questions have always been raised so intensively - this also
applies to audio engineering, broadcasting, photography, film, video and
holography. So it is hardly surprising that the beginnings of literary preoccupation
with computers are to be found in the associated area: for the first time, at
the end of the fifties in the group surrounding Max Bense in Stuttgart, and
then in Canada and the USA, in the seventies in France with OULIPO, the
workshop for potential literature, and also with individual personalities such
as Jacques Roubaud, Richard Kostellanetz, Jim Rosenberg, John Cayley, Reinhard
Doehl or Augusto de Campos, one of the fathers of concrete poetry. Sooner or
later, within the context of their literary experiments, they all concerned
themselves with the possibilities of the computer, not to mention the
theoretically farsighted designs of Max Bense and Oswald Wiener. The&nbsp;<img

variously responsible for in this country. It was also the French, who
concerned themselves early on with time in digital texts. For instance with the
relation of movement on the display or text animations on the one hand, and
perception possibilities, as well as interactive direct access possibilities
within this course of motion on the other. Also the concern was to explore the
tension between the time units of programmed text, perceived text and read text
- for example the longstanding work of Philippe Bootz on &quot;Passage&quot;, a
'poème à lecture unique' where the activity brings about irreversible results
in text generation (exists only off-line). Following on from this understanding
of time and movement one is today particularly interested in forms of
data-processing, such as for the digital conversion of text input into pictures

attribute &quot;digital&quot;, the definition of digital poetry and the
examples show: we are here concerned with, in particular, the testing of
technical possibilities and conditions under literary circumstances. But
caution is called for; one loses oneself all too easily in the cold fascination
of constantly changing developments - as well as in the complexity there of.
Don't forget the mentioned avant-garde consciousness. The consequence is
technique positivism, which is not opposed by any current aesthetic ideology
criticism of technology. The Cebit syndrome! Even if one interprets technique,
including the tools of hard and software, in the ancient world's sense of
techne, dynamically, symbolically and as a process (techne as creative and
productive workings or as art), then it is clear that the aesthetic gain of
digital literature cannot be reduced to technology. Things start to get
interesting when the dynamically technical is not only charged to the computer,
but also to those, who deal with it, and who therefore deal always also with themselves.
This includes all the techniques, which we must mentally and physically input
here. It is also interesting, when these are then short circuited: the
artistically deliberate and frequently ironical, even amusing analogy of man
and machine in the aesthetic process. This is valid e.g. for a set of text
generators, which may well produce just as meaningful or unreasonable sentences
or poems as myself; initial steps were taken in this direction as early as the
fifties with automatic texts. In addition I consider the fact, that the viewer
or reader may literally be transferred into the text and that his actions in
the data space become observable to himself and to an audience: exemplified in
the Legible City. Or I recall that reading can be hard work, as in the
mentioned work of Fietzek, where one is degraded to a module for arduous text
call, only to be rewarded with a few ironical pornographic scraps.</span></p>
